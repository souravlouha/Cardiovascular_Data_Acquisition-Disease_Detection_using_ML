 # ü´Ä AI-Augmented Heart Monitoring using ECG, PCG, and PPG Signals

This project provides a complete, AI-based system for **non-invasive detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVD)** by analyzing a combination of physiological signals ‚Äî namely **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**, **Phonocardiogram (PCG)**, and **Photoplethysmogram (PPG)**. By integrating signal processing, feature engineering, and machine learning (ML), this framework enables early diagnosis of conditions like **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**, **arrhythmias**, **valvular defects**, and **vascular dysfunctions**.

---

## üåê Motivation

Cardiovascular diseases remain the **leading cause of death globally**. However, traditional diagnostic tools such as echocardiograms, angiograms, and stress tests are:
- Costly
- Not portable
- Often inaccessible in rural/remote areas

This project aims to address this gap by developing a **low-cost, scalable, AI-driven diagnostic tool** that can work with **wearable sensors**, **digital stethoscopes**, or **simple optical devices** to collect biosignals and analyze them using smart algorithms.

## üß† System Overview

### üì• 1. Signal Acquisition

The system works on three physiological signals:
- **ECG (Electrical)**: Captures electrical impulses of the heart via electrodes placed on the skin (Lead II).
- **PCG (Acoustic)**: Captures heart sounds through a digital stethoscope, usually stored as `.wav` files.
- **PPG (Optical)**: Measures changes in blood volume via light absorption using infrared LEDs (smartwatches, pulse oximeters).

These signals are either recorded in real-time using biomedical hardware or taken from publicly available datasets.

---

### üßπ 2. Preprocessing

All raw signals are cleaned and filtered to ensure quality before analysis.

#### ECG:
- DC offset removal
- Bandpass filtering (0.5‚Äì100 Hz)
- High-pass & low-pass filtering
- Normalization

#### PCG:
- Bandpass filtering (20‚Äì950 Hz)
- Spike noise removal
- Amplitude normalization

#### PPG:
- Baseline wander correction
- Motion artifact filtering
- Moving average smoothing

‚úÖ **Why this is important**: Noise can obscure important clinical information like murmurs or QRS complexes. Preprocessing improves both human and AI interpretability.

---

### üß© 3. Segmentation & Fiducial Point Detection

#### ECG:
- **Pan-Tompkins algorithm** detects QRS complexes
- Additional logic used to locate P and T waves
- RR intervals and waveform intervals extracted

#### PCG:
- Uses **Springer Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM)** to segment into S1 ‚Üí Systole ‚Üí S2 ‚Üí Diastole
- Clear isolation of murmurs and valve sounds

#### PPG:
- Peaks, Dicrotic Notch, and Diastolic end points detected
- Used for **Pulse Rate Variability (PRV)** analysis (analogous to HRV from ECG)

üß† These fiducial points are crucial for extracting **clinical-grade features**.

---

### üìä 4. Feature Extraction

The extracted features fall into three domains:

#### üîπ Time-Domain Features:
- RR Interval (ECG)
- Heart Rate (PPG)
- Systolic and Diastolic duration (PCG)
- Pulse Transit Time (ECG + PPG combined)

#### üîπ Frequency-Domain Features:
- Power Spectral Density (PSD)
- Band energy in specific ranges
- Heart sound energy distribution (PCG)

#### üîπ Cepstral/Statistical Features:
- Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (LFCC)
- Skewness, Kurtosis, Variance
- Slope and Area under the curve

All features are normalized and compiled into feature matrices for model training.

---

### ü§ñ 5. Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models

#### ‚úÖ Classical ML Models:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Trees / Random Forest**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

These models work well with engineered features like PSD or RR intervals.

#### üöÄ Deep Learning:
- **1D CNNs**: Learn from raw waveforms directly (especially ECG/PPG)
- **2D CNNs**: Trained on spectrogram images (for PCG/PPG)
- **LSTM/GRU (optional)**: For time series classification (sequential waveforms)

#### üîÅ Hybrid Approach:
- Combines ECG + PPG or ECG + PCG for improved diagnostic accuracy
- Feature fusion or late-stage ensemble learning

---

### üìè 6. Model Evaluation Metrics

Each classifier is evaluated on:
- **Accuracy**
- **Sensitivity (Recall)** ‚Äì true positive rate
- **Specificity** ‚Äì true negative rate
- **Precision and F1-Score**
- **ROC Curve and AUC**

This ensures models are **clinically reliable** and not just technically accurate.
