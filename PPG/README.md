## ðŸŸ£ Understanding PPG Signals (Photoplethysmogram)

**Photoplethysmogram (PPG)** is an optical signal that reflects **blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue**. It is widely used for **non-invasive cardiovascular monitoring**, typically through wearable devices like smartwatches and pulse oximeters.

### ðŸŒŸ What is a PPG Signal?

A PPG signal is generated by shining a light (usually infrared or red) into the skin and measuring the amount of light either transmitted or reflected to a photodetector. The variation in light absorption corresponds to changes in blood flow with each heartbeat.

### ðŸ§  Components of a PPG Waveform

A single PPG pulse waveform includes:
- **Systolic peak**: Corresponds to ventricular contraction and blood ejection
- **Dicrotic notch**: Caused by closure of the aortic valve
- **Diastolic wave**: Reflects pressure in arteries during ventricular relaxation

Each PPG cycle provides information about heart rate, blood flow, arterial stiffness, and vascular health.

### ðŸ“¥ PPG Signal Acquisition

- **Sensors**: Infrared LED + photodiode setup
- **Locations**: Fingertips, wrist, earlobe
- **Sampling Rate**: Typically 100â€“1000 Hz
- **Common Devices**: Pulse oximeters, smartwatches (e.g., Apple Watch, Mi Band)

### ðŸ§ª PPG Signal Processing Steps

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Bandpass filtering to remove motion and ambient light artifacts
   - DC component removal (baseline correction)
   - Signal smoothing with moving average or Gaussian filters

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - **Time-domain**: Peak-to-peak interval, pulse width, slope, area
   - **Frequency-domain**: HRV, respiratory rate from FFT
   - **Statistical**: Mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis

3. **Pulse Rate Variability (PRV)**:
   - Similar to HRV from ECG
   - Derived from intervals between successive PPG peaks

4. **Normalization**:
   - Rescale amplitude for comparison across subjects

### ðŸ§  PPG with Machine Learning and AI

- **ML Models**: SVM, Decision Tree, KNN using statistical and morphological features
- **Deep Learning**: CNN/LSTM on raw waveform or scalogram
- **Hybrid Models**: Combine PPG + ECG for more accurate diagnosis

### ðŸ“ˆ Example PPG Processing Workflow (MATLAB-style)

```matlab
% Step 1: Load PPG signal
data = load('ppg_sample.txt');

% Step 2: Bandpass filter (e.g., 0.5 â€“ 8 Hz)
filtered = bandpass(data, [0.5 8], 1000);

% Step 3: Smooth signal
smooth_ppg = movmean(filtered, 10);

% Step 4: Detect peaks
[pks, locs] = findpeaks(smooth_ppg, 'MinPeakDistance', 200);

% Step 5: Feature extraction
RR_intervals = diff(locs);  % Pulse-to-pulse intervals
mean_rr = mean(RR_intervals);
```
